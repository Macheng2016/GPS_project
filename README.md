This folder contains codes that use Branch & Bound method ('combinatorial_optimization_BB.m') and Cross Entropy method ('optimization_with_non_common_noise.m')

that solve the combinatorial optimization described in Shen et al. [1]

[1] Shen, Macheng, Ding Zhao, and Jing Sun. "Optimization of Vehicle Connections in V2V-based Cooperative Localization." arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.08818 (2017).
